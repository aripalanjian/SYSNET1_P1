About The Project
    This project simulates a simple production shell.
    The program tokenizes a series of strings entered in the command line, the tokens are then parsed
        and stored in a object. If the arguments in the param object are recognized a combination of
         a command and options or just a command the processes will execute the statement.

Steps to run:
    1) In the project directory run the command make
    2) In the command line enter ./main to start the shell
    3) To use debug mode enter ./main -Debug in the command line

Running the command "make clean" will remove the executables, objects, and any .txt files in the directory.
