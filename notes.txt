Your program must perform the following actions:
1. Display a prompt on stdout.
2. Accept a command as a string from the user (input string will terminate with a newline character). The
program must terminate when the command exit is entered.
3. Parse the input string into tokens, which are single words delimited by one or more spaces, tabs, or newline
characters.
4. Store the tokens in the fields of class Param.
5. Print the contents of the fields using printParams() function, which is provided and explained below, but
only when the shell is started with the debug option â€“Debug on the command line. Otherwise, the contents
of the string will not be printed.
6. Return back to step 1.
